A Script To Like All The Posts On The Instagram Account You Provide Made In puppeteer.js
Throw in your credentials in creds.js file.
Add the link of the page to be liked on like 3 on variable url.
Change headless property to false on line 8 if you want to see the script running.
Posts liked will be displayed in the console at the end.
One more thing don't run the script on more then one account per hour due to instagram automation restrictions.
